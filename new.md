Dear Robin,

I'm writing to express my interest in the recently advertised Data Scientist position at Finn. I am very interested in this opportunity and believe I could bring valuable skills and experience. 

I'm currently working at Finn on a data science product to help the data team interpret what Finn's banking chatbot is learning through the model and what are the sources of errors.

A little more about me, I am a Master of Data Science student at UBC and my previous work experience includes 3 years of predictive modelling in the banking and technology verticals using machine learning. Finn's AI chatbot is the perfect marriage between banking and NLP and this is what gets me most excited about this position. 

I firmly believe that I can be a valuable asset to your team. I welcome the opportunity to speak with you about this position and how my experience fits the description. 

Thank you in advance for your consideration.
