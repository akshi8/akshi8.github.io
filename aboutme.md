Hi there! I'm Akshi Chaudhary.

Iâ€™m [Master of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/) program at the University of British Columbia, Canada.
I also mentor and volunteer at the Vancouver tech events for women like [R-Ladies](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-Vancouver/photos/28625161/470974764/) and [Women Who Code](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Vancouver). I worked in technology, banking and entertainment vertical as data analyst to build anti-fraud model and recommender systems.

I am a huge advocate for `data science for social good`, in my free hours I explore data science applications to solve challenging social problems. I love playing basketball, support local stand-up scene and go out on a hike!
