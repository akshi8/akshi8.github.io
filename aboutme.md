Hi there! I'm Akshi Chaudhary.

Iâ€™m a graduate of [Master of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/) program at the University of British Columbia, Canada.
I have worked in technology, banking and entertainment verticals as data analyst to build anti-fraud model, social media recommender systems and conversational chatbots.
I also mentor and volunteer at the Vancouver tech events for women like [R-Ladies](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-Vancouver/photos/28625161/470974764/) and [Women Who Code](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Vancouver).

I am a huge advocate for `data science for social good`, in my free hours I explore data science applications to solve challenging social problems. I love playing basketball, watching stand-up comedy and on a sunny day hiking!

Here is my online [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FJ6yyWpaH-Mcmm_B3HIxqgWTfUSdO0Vb/view?usp=sharing) if you want to know more about my experience, education and achievements.
